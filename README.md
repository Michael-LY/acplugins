R&amp;D about the upcoming server plugin infrastrucure of Assetto Corsa, driving simulator by Kunos simulazioni

There is already a lot discussion and preparation for the day 1.2 hits us, have a start here 
http://www.assettocorsa.net/forum/index.php?threads/about-that-maybe-server-api.24360/

This project is done to share all kinds of prototyping, preparation and testing stuff in multiple projects and languages.
I don't really know but I think "real" projects (e.g. a distinct plugin) should get it's own project.
